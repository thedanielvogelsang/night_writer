# DTR: Define the Relationship

Use this template to when conducting DTR with your project partners. It's recommended that you copy/paste this template into your own gist each time you conduct a DTR to take notes on the conversation.

### Guiding Questions to Define The Relationship:

* What are your learning goals for this project? What drives us in this project?
* What is your collaboration style? How do you feel about pair programming vs. divide-and-conquer approaches?
* How do you communicate best? How do you appreciate receiving communication from others?
* How would you describe your work style?
* What are your strengths? How can our strengths complement each other?
* Whatâ€™s gone well or poorly in your previous projects?
* How will we set direction and make decisions as a team?
* How will we overcome obstacles?
* What do you need (resources, environment, communication) to do your best work?
* What scheduling restraints do you have? What are your scheduling preferences?
* What is your style for giving feedback? Does anything ever hold you back from giving feedback?
* What do you identify as being your biggest strength(s) technically, as they relate to this project? Where do you feel you could use improvement in your technical skills, as they relate to this project? How can our team help support you in improving these skills?
* What tools do you want to use to manage the project?
* How do you want the group to solve problems when members run into issues with features of the project?
* How do you know if a project is successful? How can we achieve that as a group?
* How will we recognize each other's successes and celebrate them?

### Template for DTR Memo

Project: Night_Writer

Group Member Names: Daniel Vogelsang (V) / Daniel Phillips (P)

Project Expectations: What does each group member hope to get out of this project?

  V - Nail down all the things.
  P - Get good at Chess not checkers.

Goals and expectations:

Team strengths:
  Technical
  V - enumerables; arrays; pry
    weaknesses: instance variables ; communication between classes ; linked-lists ; hashes ; FILE IO/ ARGV

  P - enumerables; methods; pry
    weaknesses: attr_reader/writer/accessor ; class variables ; FILE IO/ARGV

  Soft-Skills
  V - No pretense; desire continual and honest communication > project ruberic goals;

  P - Open with commmunicaton and with vision; no pretense;

How to overcome obstacles:
 Communicaton after intentional self-exploration; honesty about your struggles;
 Voice concerns/have convo with returning to DTR/show willingness to go the extra mile while making new

Schedule Expectations (When are we available to work together and individually?):
  Daniel V NOT GOOD: [immediately after class; nighttime after 11; friday/saturday evening/night (when I work)]
     --- Saturday 9am - 2pm
     --- Sunday all day
     --- Evenings after 6:00 til 11
  Daniel P: Prefer weekends over evenings for cognitive purposes.

Communication Expectations (How and often will we communicate? How do we keep lines of communication open?):
  Open communication, leave the ego at the door.
  Focus on task at hand -- V's autism.
  Direct communication.
  P will be honest when he needs a different environment/ needs to leave to relax his brain.

Abilities Expectations (Technical strengths and areas for desired improvement):
  FileIO, interacting with arrays/enumerating, hash work/calling, 

Workload Expectations (What features do we each want to work on?):
  DanP: FileIO, split methods between us
  DanV: DictionaryHash, swapping methods; reading methods

Workflow Expectations (Git workflow/Tools/Code Review/Reviewing Pull Requests): 
  Keep an open dialogue on all aspects of the project, particularly before pushing anything. 
  Ultimately we decided to keep master versions on DanP's computer while we struggled with figuring out proper workflow (still learning github)
  We only pulled and merged with eachother's consent, and in person.

Expectations for giving and receiving feedback:
  Open and straightforward about our needs/wants. No passive-aggressive nonesense. 

Agenda to discuss project launch:
  Pseudocode Each element of the writer
  Build DictionaryHash
  Build TDD - methods 
  follow pseudocde and integrate methods
  Pseudocode each element of the reader
  build methods
  integrate

Ideas:
  Dictionary Hash of characters (took awhile)
  We need to keep top mid bottom layers separate. 
  Chunking/Span'ing the strings may work
  definitely interplaying between arrays (to shift) and strings(to chunk)
  File IO can come after we build the pieces of the project first

Tools:
  pry (both in command line, and required in different parts of the code)
  tdd
  irb
  atom
  commandline/terminal
